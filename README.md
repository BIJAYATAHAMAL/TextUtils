Created a Python-based web application, TextUtils, enabling users to perform various text transformations  
such as case conversion and whitespace removal.  Integrated user-friendly interfaces with backend logic
to process and display real-time text modifications.
		 Applied principles of clean code and modular programming
to enhance maintainability and scalability.
